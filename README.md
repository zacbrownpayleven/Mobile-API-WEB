# Payleven Mobile API - Web PHP SDK

The PaylevenAppApi makes possible for app developers to open the payleven application from within their own apps and process payments. Although the payment is initiated on your app, it is the payleven application that takes care of handling the payment process. After a payment is processed, it will open your app and notify if the payment was successful, canceled or failed. 

#### Main Features
- Connects to payleven EMV/PCI certified card reader via bluetooth
- Accept all major card schemes such as Visa, Mastercard or American Express
- Provide immediate information about the payment status 
- Refund card payments
- Supports cash payment method
- Supports all main languages

#### Limitations
- Available only on the markets where [payleven](https://payleven.com/) operates
- Limited control on the UI 

#### Prerequisites
######Step 1 - Create a merchant account
To process a transaction you need to login in the payleven app with our payleven account. You can create an account by registering on our [webiste](https://payleven.co.uk/registration/?login=). Make sure to register for the country you wish.

######Step 2 - Create a developer account
To grant your application access to paylevenâ€™s API you need to [register](https://developer.payleven.com/) and receive an API key. Please keep in mind that you should use your final app specifications (e.g bundle-ID for iOS or package name for Android) during the registration since these will be used in combination with your API key to identify of your app.

######Step 3 - Install the payleven app
Althought the payment is initiated in your app; the actual transaction takes place within the payleven app. For this reason, the payleven app must be installed on the mobile device you wish to use for accepting card payments.

######Step 4 - Purchase card reader
To accept card payments, you need to purchase a card reader. This is possible on our [website](https://payleven.co.uk/registration/?login=) during the registration or in your [payleven account](https://service.payleven.com/uk/ordermain) after registration. 
For testing purposes a card reader is not necessarily needed as the transaction flow can be tested using another payment methods: e.g. cash.

### Installation

This SDK is easily installable via `composer`. If your project does not use composer, download the source from this repo, and include the `autoloader.php` file in your application.

#### Usage

##### Instantiate the payleven Object

Use your application's API key, bundleID (domain), and return request configuration to instantiate the Payleven object class.

```php
    $app = new Payleven\Payleven([
        'api_key' => '{your api key}',
        'bundle_id' => '{your bundle/domain}',
        'return_domain' => '{your return domain}',
        'return_page' => '{your return page}',
        'display_name' => '{display name}',
        'return_scheme' => '{return url scheme}',
        'payment_currency' => '{your currency}'
    ]);
```

##### Start A Payment

Start a payment in the Payleven App. This is assuming you've initialized the Payleven object to the `$app` variable:

```php
    $app->startPayment('{payment price in cents}', '{order ID}', '{order description}');

    $app->redirect();

```

The `startPayment` method exposes the generated url as returned in a `string`. If you'd like to handle the redirect on your own, assign that to a variable:

```php
    $url = $app->startPayment('...');
```

Otherwise, you can use the built in `redirect` method to let us handle it.


##### Start A Refund

Start a refund in the Payleven App. This is assuming you've initialized the Payleven object to the `$app` variable:

```php
    $app->startRefund('{order ID}');

    $app->redirect();

```

The `startRefund` method exposes the generated url as returned in a `string`. If you'd like to handle the redirect on your own, assign that to a variable:

```php
    $url = $app->startRefund('...');
```

Otherwise, you can use the built in `redirect` method to let us handle it.

##### Start Transaction Details

Start the Transaction Details for a specific order in the Payleven App. This is assuming you've initialized the Payleven object to the `$app` variable:

```php
    $app->startTransactionDetails('{order ID}');

    $app->redirect();

```

The `startTransactionDetails` method exposes the generated url as returned in a `string`. If you'd like to handle the redirect on your own, assign that to a variable:

```php
    $url = $app->startTransactionDetails('...');
```

Otherwise, you can use the built in `redirect` method to let us handle it.

##### Start Payment History

Start the payment history interface in the Payleven App. This is assuming you've initialized the Payleven object to the `$app` variable:

```php
    $app->startPaymentHistory();

    $app->redirect();

```

The `startPaymentHistory` method exposes the generated url as returned in a `string`. If you'd like to handle the redirect on your own, assign that to a variable:

```php
    $url = $app->startPaymentHistory();
```

Otherwise, you can use the built in `redirect` method to let us handle it.

##### Validate Response

HMAC calculation is used to verify that the response actually came from the intended sender. In order to ensure the data you are receiving to your `retrun` endpoint, you should always validate the response. This also assumes you've initialized the Payleven object to the `$app` variable.

```php
    $valid = $app->validateResponse();


```

This method returns a `boolean` value fo `true` or `false`, depedning upon the validity of the response.

 ##### Accessing the Response Data

 After the mobile API returns it's response to your return endpoint, you can simply access the information via the `$_REQUEST` object. Here is a list of all response fields provided by the Payleven Mobile API:
 ```php
    $responseBody = array(
        'result' => $_REQUEST['result'],
        'description' => $_REQUEST['description'],
        'orderId' => $_REQUEST['orderId'],
        'errorCode' => $_REQUEST['errorCode'],
        'amount' => $_REQUEST['amount'],
        'tipAmount' => $_REQUEST['tipAmount'],
        'currency' => $_REQUEST['currency'],
        'is_duplicate_receipt' => $_REQUEST['is_duplicate_receipt'],
        'payment_method' => $_REQUEST['payment_method'],
        'expire_month' => $_REQUEST['expire_month'],
        'expire_year' => $_REQUEST['expire_year'],
        'effective_month' => $_REQUEST['effective_month'],
        'effective_year' => $_REQUEST['effective_year'],
        'aid' => $_REQUEST['aid'],
        'application_label'	=> $_REQUEST['application_label'],
        'application_preferred_name' => $_REQUEST['application_preferred_name'],
        'pan' => $_REQUEST['pan'],
        'issuer_identification_number' => $_REQUEST['issuer_identification_number'],
        'pan_seq' => $_REQUEST['pan_seq'],
        'card_scheme' => $_REQUEST['card_scheme'],
        'bank_code'	=> $_REQUEST['bank_code'],
        'pos_entry_mode' => $_REQUEST['pos_entry_mode'],
        'merchant_id' => $_REQUEST['merchant_id'],
        'merchant_display_name' => $_REQUEST['merchant_display_name'],
        'auth_code' => $_REQUEST['auth_code'],
        'terminal_id' => $_REQUEST['terminal_id'],
        'api_version' => $_REQUEST['api_version'],
        'timestamp' => $_REQUEST['timestamp']
    );

 ```

 Then, you can simply access the data form the `$responseBody` array. You can, of course, interact with the `$_REQUEST` object in any way that suits your application best.
